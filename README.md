# Crushing Bugs Project

This is a drag and drop puzzle game that features four different puzzles to complete. 
In this prject, I crushed two different bugs that were a problem in the files we worked through in class. The first problem with the code was that you could drag more than one puzzle piece on top of each other. The second bug was that the puzzle pieces would stay on the puzzle board after changing the puzzle set that you want.
